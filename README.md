 # Medicinal Leaf Identification using PernNet

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
Medicinal Leaf Identification using **PernNet** is a deep learning project aimed at classifying medicinal leaves based on image recognition. It leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyze leaf patterns and identify plant species accurately. The model is trained on a curated dataset with various medicinal plant images and employs data augmentation techniques to enhance accuracy. 

### Key Features:
- **Custom PernNet Model** for precise classification.
- **High Accuracy** achieved through deep learning.
- **Preprocessing & Augmentation** for improved model generalization.
- **Scalability** for integrating into mobile or web applications.
